          <br />
          I'm Camdyn Bordelon. I'm a recent graduate at Western Governors University (March 2025), achieving a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
          <br /><br />
          I quite enjoy statistics, as well as programming, which led me to pursing that degree in Computer Science. Data is particularly fascinating to me, leading to my interest in database applications, data analytics and machine learning.
          <br /><br />
          Outside of work and education, I enjoy lifting weights, watching movies, and spending time outdoors. I especially enjoy being in nature; nothing beats sunshine and fresh air.

        <h2>Larger Projects</h2>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: medium;">Source code for all of these projects (and others) can be found on my
          <a href="https://github.com/camdyn-dev">GitHub</a>.</span>

          <a href="https://github.com/camdyn-dev/clickstop"
            >ClickStop - E-commerce web app</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          ClickStop was the first significant project that truly tested my programming skills. I decided to create it after finishing a programming boot camp, 
          and I'm delighted that I did; it greatly developed my programming and problem-solving skills.
          <br />
          <br />
          ClickStop is an E-Commerce web application that uses JavaScript and HTML/CSS on the front end, with Express, Node.Js, and MongoDB on the back end. 
          It features an authentication and authorization system using B-Crypt, which enables account creation, item reviews, and order history. To prevent spam, 
          I implemented two-factor authentication with a mail system written with NodeMailer that requires accounts to be verified before posting item reviews. 
          Furthermore, an administrative back-end system allows me to create, edit, update, and delete item postings and view sales data.

          <a href="https://github.com/camdyn-dev/csei"
            >CSEI - An AI/ML program that predicts coffee shop revenue</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a significant focus on AI/ML during my bachelor's degree's final classes, leading to this program's creation. 
          We were tasked with building an advanced AI/ML program that tackles a real-world problem. Since 
          I've spent a large portion of my young adult years working in coffee shops, this was close to my heart.
          <br />
          <br />
          This program implements a Random Forest trained regression model with strong hyperparameter tuning (i.e., Grid Search) to predict a shop's daily revenue based on key operational parameters (e.g., locational foot traffic, number of customers, 
          marketing expenditure), thus allowing management to improve efficiency in those parameters. This solution was implemented in Python
          with Pandas and Scikit Learn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/camdyn-dev/gametracker-react"
            >GameTracker - Game tracking app</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After familiarizing myself with React, I decided it would be appropriate to develop those skills further by creating a 
          practical yet challenging application. That pursuit led to a game backlog tracking application with React and MUI on the front end 
          and Express with MySQL on the back end.
          <br />
          <br />
          It supports a variety of filtering and sorting options that are made
 possible by the rating system that I've implemented. You can rate
 games by priority, completion status, and quality, then only show games
 based on those. Each game has its list of notes that allows
 you to track finer things, such as "wow, level 2 SUCKED" or "don't
 forget the secret room in level 4".

        <p>
          If I'm honest, this project exists because I found a YouTube video on Three.Js that was quite interesting. This led to the thought, "Wow, a portfolio that 
          implements Three.Js would be quite beautiful", which, in turn, led to this website.
          <br />
          <br />
          An interesting detail I'd like to mention is that the planets on here have the same (relative) rotational speed as in real life. Earth takes about a 
          minute and 45 seconds to make a complete rotation on its axis, with Mars rotating a little slower and Jupiter more than twice as fast. The 
          moon takes about 50 minutes to rotate on its axis and fully rotate around Earth.
