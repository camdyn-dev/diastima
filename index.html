        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/camdynbordelon/">LinkedIn</a> |
          <a href="https://github.com/camdyn-dev">Github</a> |
          <a href="mailto:camdyn@tutanota.com">Email</a>

          <br />
          <br />
          I'm a Full-Stack developer (heavy preference towards back-end,
          however) with previous experience and education in Information
          Security. Notably, I'm CompTIA Security+ certified and an Associate of
          (ISC)2.
          <br /><br />
          Javascript is currently my main language, as the vast majority of work
          I do relates to web development, but I'm more than competent in both
          Python and C. My current toolkit (as of 07/22) is as follows;
          <br />
          <br />
          Languages: Javascript, Python, SQL, C
          <br />
          Databases: MySQL/Postegres, MongoDB + Atlas
          <br />
          Frameworks: React, Node.js/Express
          <br />
          Tools: Git/Github, AWS, Heroku, Cloudinary
          <br /><br />
          Of course, I posess a lot of knowledge and skills with hardware and
          networking from tinkering with systems, but I won't list them out as
          my certifications and education show them.
          <br />
          <br />

          experience can be viewed at my

        <h2>Larger Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Source code for all of these projects (and others) can be found on my
          <a href="https://github.com/camdyn-dev">GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://clickstop.herokuapp.com"
            >ClickStop - E-commerce web app</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I created ClickStop a little while after finishing a programming
          bootcamp to test the skills that I learned. It uses MongoDb, Express,
          Node.js and handles payments with Paypal, as I didn't know Stripe at
          the time.
          <br />
          <br />
          It features an authentication system using B-Crypt (instead of a
          library like Passport), allowing account creation, reviews and order
          history. To prevent spam, I implemented a mailing system that requires
          accounts to be verified before posting reviews. There's also a
          back-end management system that allows me to create, edit and delete
          item postings.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/camdyn-dev/gametracker-react"
            >GameTracker - Game tracking app</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After picking up React, I decided to test out the skills by making a
          complex, but useful application. It uses React with MUI on the
          front-end, and Express with MySQL for the back-end.
          <br />
          <br />
          It supports a variety of filtering and sorting options that are made
          possible by the rating system that I've implemented. You can rate
          games by priority, completion status and quality, then only show games
          based off of those. Each game has it's own list of notes that allows
          you to track finer things, such as "wow, level 2 SUCKED", or "don't
          forget the secret room in level 4". If I'm honest, designing and
          implementing the sorting system was a pain in the ass. Currently
          working on a video to present it.

          There wasn't anything really special behind this; I found out what
          Three.JS was one night and thought it'd be fun to experiment with.
          That's especially apparent in the name I chose for this.
          <br />
          <br />
          An interesting little detail though; the planets on here have the same
          (relative) rotational speed as in real life. Earth takes about a
          minute and 45 seconds to make a full rotation on it's axis, with Mars
          rotating a little slower, and Jupiter more than twice as fast. The
          moon takes about 50 minutes to rotate on it's axis, and make a full
          rotation around Earth.

        <h2>Education and Certifications</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the knowledge I've gained in programming has been from
          self-study, either through books, Udemy or the aforementioned
          projects, but I'm currently pursuing an Associates in Computer Science
          at Los Rios Colleges to make it "official".
          <br />
          <br />
          As mentioned previously, I'm a certified CompTIA Security+, Network+
          and A+, and an Associate of (ISC)2 specializing in Information
          Governance and Leadership. I acquired these while attending Brighton
          College (now LearnKey, 2018-2020).
