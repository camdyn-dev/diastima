This is my portfolio that I made using Three.Js.

One feature I'd like to highlight is that the planets have the same relative rotational speed that they do in real life. Here are the datapoints to demonstrate this.

| Planet/Moon | IRL Time            | Website Time            |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Earth       | 23 hours 56 minutes | ~ 1 minute 45 seconds     |
| Moon        | 27 days             | ~ 47 minutes 15 seconds |
| Mars        | 24 hours 37 minutes | ~ 2 minutes          |
| Jupiter     | 9 hours 56 minutes | ~ 44 seconds            |


PS. "diastima" is the greek word for "space".
