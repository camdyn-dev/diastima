### Hey!

This is my portfolio constructed with Three.js. I spent about a night making it, and think it turned out pretty well! One cool little thing is that the planets rotate at the same relative speed as they do in real life. If I remember correctly, what that means is since (I coded) Earth to make a full rotation around it's axis every two minutes, it takes the moon roughly twelve hours to make a full rotation around the Earth. Similar rules apply for the other planets (Mars rotates a little bit slower since the days are similar, while Jupiter is roughly 2 1/2 times faster since a day is only 10 hours over there). Thanks for checking it out!

PS. "diastima" is the greek word for "space".
