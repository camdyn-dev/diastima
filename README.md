This is my portfolio that I made using Three.Js. I spent a night or so making it, and I think it turned out pretty well.

Something that's cool that I worked in is that the planets rotate around the sun at the same rate they do in real life, relative to one another. What I mean by that is I coded the Earth to make a full rotation around its axis within this project every two mintues, and set every other planet and mimic that rate. It looks roughly like this

| Planet/Moon | IRL Time            | Website Time            |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Earth       | 23 hours 56 minutes | ~ 1 minute 45 seconds     |
| Moon        | 27 days             | ~ 47 minutes 15 seconds |
| Mars        | 24 hours 37 minutes | ~ 2 minutes          |
| Jupiter     | 9 hours 56 minutes | ~ 44 seconds            |

These rates roughly mimic the ones they do in real life, which I thought was a neat detail to add!

PS. "diastima" is the greek word for "space".
